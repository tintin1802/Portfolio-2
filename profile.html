        <h2>Hello, I am Etin</h2>

        <p>
          I am passionate about building technology that solves real problems and creates meaningful user experiences.
          My background as a Business Analyst, Scrum Master, and Business Agility Lead has given me a strong foundation
          in understanding user needs, collaborating with engineering teams, and supporting Agile delivery.
          Through the WIT Full Stack Development program, I am strengthening my technical abilities with hands on coding
          and problem solving, allowing me to contribute more directly to software development.
          I am also exploring how agentic AI can advance automation, security, and data governance in modern systems.
          My goal is to bring together my technical training, analytical mindset, and leadership experience to build
          digital solutions that are impactful, scalable, and user centered.

        I am learning the fundamentals of front end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I use HTML to structure web pages, CSS to style and make them responsive, and JavaScript to add simple interactivity. Through hands on practice and projects, 
        I am building a solid understanding of how web pages are created and how these technologies work together.
